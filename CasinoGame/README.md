# Casino Game

This is simple console game where you guess a number between 1 and 10. If your guess is correct then you'll win 10x the amount that you bet
and lose the money you bet if you're wrong. 

You start by putting money into your balance. Then you bet money from your balance. If you have no money at the end, there'll be an option for 
you to put more money into your balance. 

### Caveat 

The code was designed for Linux systems, if you're on Windows you'll have to change "system("clear") to system("cls"). Both do the 
same (clearing the console screen) but it's just different command names for different systems.
