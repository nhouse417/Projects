# Linear Regression on the California Housing Dataset

The goal of this project was to learn how to implement linear regression without using popular libraries such as scikit-learn and then learn how to implement it using 
scikit-learn along with learning how to use matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization and analysis. The California Housing dataset was used because it's a simple
dataset for learning how to implement ML regression algorithms. 

## File Descriptions

- linear_regression_v1.py -> my implementation of linear regression 
- linear_regression_sklearn.py -> linear regression implementation using pipelines
- test.py -> used to test implementing pipelines using examples from the scikit-learn library
- test_tools.py -> this tested the tools.py file functions to make sure they were working as intended
- tools.py -> implemented functions compute_cost, compute_gradient, and gradient_descent that are needed for linear regression
  - this file is an ongoing file that will be used for my implementation of logistic regression in the future
