# Design of Mechanical System 

I worked with two other engineering students to create from scratch the mechanical system used to open and close the door. 
In this system, we used a windshield wiper motor, typically used in cars, to open and close the door, and we used an electric strike 
that was used to lock and unlock the door. We created a circuit that would send signals to both of these parts to open/close the door.
The circuit got the signals from a Raspberry Pi when facial recognition was successful.

This folder contains pictures of the circuit, our wiring diagram, and a video demonstrating a successful prototype.
